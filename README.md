### Midterm project for Creative Coding - DM-UY 1133

This sketch is a website on keshi. There are two pages, one called "music" and one called "artist". The artist page leads to a brief introduction to Keshi and the genre of music he creates, with a quote about his music by Fred Thomas [(AllMusic)](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/keshi-mn0003732692#:~:text=Vocalist%2C%20instrumentalist%2C%20and%20songwriter%20Keshi,textural%20instrumentals%2C%20and%20booming%20drums.) The music page displays three of his albums: "GABRIEL", "the reaper", "always". Clicking on any of the albums takes you to the album page where a random song is selected and lyrics are playing on the screen to the right of the album image. The song's name is shown under the album to let you know what song was chosen. Clicking out of the page (going back to the music page) then going back to that specific album page, another random song will be playing.
